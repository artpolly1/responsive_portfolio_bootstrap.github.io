                    <p class="p-margins mx-3">Hi! My name is Arthur. I consider myself a hard-worker who enjoys thinking critically to solve complex problems. My background in management strategies, classroom leadership and research inform my strategic approach.  As an educator and lifelong learner, my passion for increasing access and closing opportunity gaps fuel my passion for coding/web-development. Furthermore, I am a “forever student,” so I fervently pursue opportunities to gain new knowledge through research, career focused conferences and continued coursework. </p>

                    <p class="p-margins mx-3">My hunger for new knowledge and making tech accessible for students who look like me has contributed to my most recent career switch. I believe Tech is the wave of the future and most students who live in high to moderate poverty are rarely exposed to the Tech industry. I see this as a gap that would shift social barriers in a way that policy has failed in the past. </p>

                    <p class="p-margins mx-3"> I believe that commitment, mindfulness, and self-motivation in the workplace is key to success—a tenet I live out through my interest in sports, writing, and public speaking. It is important to know that I new to this arena but I can learn and I am always interested in a challenge. </p>
